### A geo-informatics project that suggests and recommends nearby hospitals to an user based on their current location. 

----

Tech Stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Django
- GeoDjango and its various dependencies
- PostgreSQL
- PostGIS

Current features:
- Gives a list of hospitals based on the current location of the user
- Scope of map is till Mumbai, however can be easily extended to more area
- The map has a search of its own, which also displays a table containing information about the hospital as recorded in the database

Future scope (things we hope of including and revamping our website with):
- A custom search bar which would take typed in location of the user to search for hospitals in some other vicinity
- The map should point out (mark) all the locations displayed in the list and their distance from the current location, and not just display the whole map idly
